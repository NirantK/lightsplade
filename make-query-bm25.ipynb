The reason is that independent contractor vs employee is supposed to be defined by your job function, not by your choice. If you were a contractor and then switched to be an employee without changing your job description, then the IRS could claim that you should have always been an employee the entire time, and so should every one of the other contractors that work for that company with a similar job function. It\\'s a hornet\\'s nest that the employer may not want to poke. But that\\'s not your problem; what should you do about it? When you say \"\"he added my Federal and FICA W/H together\"\", do you mean that total appears in box 4 of your 1099? If so, it sounds like the employer is expecting you to re-pay the employer portion of FICA. Can you ask them if they actually paid it? If they did, then I don\\'t see them having a choice but to issue a W2, since the IRS would be expecting one. If they didn\\'t pay your FICA, then the amount this will cost you is 7.65% of what would have been your W2 wages. IMHO it would be reasonable for you to request that they send you a check for that extra amount. Note: even though that amount will be less than $600 and you won\\'t receive a 1099 in 2017 for it, legally you\\'ll still have to pay tax on that amount so I think a good estimate would be to call it 10% instead. Depending on your personality and your relationship with the employer, if they choose not to \"\"make you whole\"\", you could threaten to fill out form SS-8. Additional Info: (Thank you Bobson for bringing this up.) The situation you find yourself in is similar to the concept of \"\"Contract-to-Hire\"\". You start off as a contractor, and later convert to an employee. In order to avoid issuing a 1099 and W2 to the same person in a single tax year, companies typically utilize one of the following strategies: Your particular situation is closest to situation 2, but the reverse. Instead of retroactively calling you a W2 employee the entire time, your employer is cheating and attempting to classify you as a 1099 contractor the entire time. This is frowned upon by the IRS, as well as the employee since as you discovered it costs you more money in the form of employer FICA. From your description it sounds like your employer was trying to do you a favor and didn\\'t quite follow through with it. What they should have done was never switch you to W2 in the first place (if you really should have been a contractor), or they should have done the conversion properly without stringing you along.\"'], 'doc_id': ['232544'], 'score': 19.743473052978516}\n",

For an HSA established by a   self-employed (or unemployed) individual, the individual can   contribute.

It sounds like you have a family plan. Additional contribution.   If you are an eligible individual who is   age 55 or older at the end of your tax year, your contribution limit   is increased by $1,000. Rules for married people.   If either spouse has family HDHP coverage, both spouses are treated as having family HDHP coverage. If   each spouse has family coverage under a separate plan, the   contribution limit for 2014 is $6,550. You must reduce the limit on   contributions, before taking into account any additional   contributions, by the amount contributed to both spouses' Archer MSAs.   After that reduction, the contribution limit is split equally between   the spouses unless you agree on a different division. The rules for married people apply only if both spouses are eligible   individuals. If both spouses are 55 or older and not enrolled in Medicare, each   spouse's contribution limit is increased by the additional   contribution. If both spouses meet the age requirement, the total   contributions under family coverage cannot be more than $8,550. Each   spouse must make the additional contribution to his or her own HSA.

      "{'body': [\"Edit: Let's forget about Wikipedia.  From the horse's mouth: The cafeteria plan rules require that a health FSA provide uniform coverage throughout the    coverage period (which is the period when the employee is covered by the plan).  See Proposed    Treasury Regulations Section 1.125-5(d).  Under the uniform coverage rules, the maximum amount    of reimbursement from a health FSA must be available at all times during the coverage period.  This    means that the employee’s entire health FSA election is available from the first day of the plan year    to reimburse qualified medical expenses incurred during the coverage period.  The cafeteria plan    may not, therefore, base its reimbursements to an employee on what that employee may have    contributed up to any particular date, such as the date the employee is laid-off or terminated.  Thus,    if an employee’s reimbursements from the health FSA exceed his contributions to the health FSA at    the time of lay-off or termination, the employer cannot recoup the difference from the employee. (emphasis added)  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/1012060.pdf Uniform Coverage Rule The IRS has required that “health FSAS must qualify as accident or health plans. This means    that, in general, while the health coverage under the FSA need not be provided through a    commercial insurance contract, health FSAS must exhibit the risk-shifting and risk-distribution    characteristics of insurance.” This concept has led to the “uniform coverage” rule.  The uniform\\xadcoverage rule requires that the maximum amount of an employee’s projected    elective contributions to a health FSA must be available from the first day of the plan year to    reimburse the employee’s qualified medical expenses, regardless of the amount actually    contributed to the plan at the time that reimbursement is sought.  Citing proposed Treasury Regulations Section  the IRS General Counsel has    determined that:  “Under the uniform coverage rules, the maximum amount of reimbursement from    a health FSA must be available at all times during the coverage period. The    cafeteria plan may not, therefore, base its reimbursements to an employee on what    that employee may have contributed up to any particular date, such as the date the    employee is laid-off or terminated. Thus, if an employee’s reimbursements from    the health FSA exceed his contributions to the health FSA at the time of  or    termination, the employer cannot recoup the difference from the employee.”  This rule is unfair and also constitutes a disincentive to establishing FSAS because of the    exposure to out-of pocket expenditures arising from employees who leave the company.  NSBA believes that the uniform coverage rule should also be revised if the  or lose-   it rule is changed. Revising the use-it or lose-it rule while leaving the uniform coverage rule unchanged will introduce an inappropriate asymmetry to FSAS. An employer should    be allowed to deduct any negative amount arising from insuftîcient employee    contributions from a terminating partieipant’s last paycheck. http://www.ecfc.org/files/legislative-news/NSBA_(David_Burton).pdf (emphasis added)  Now, that's some fresh bitterness for you right there.
