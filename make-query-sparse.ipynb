The social security and Medicare taxes you pay to cover your employee's share must be included in the employee's wages for income tax purposes. However, they are not counted as social security and Medicare wages or as federal unemployment (FUTA) wages.

I found it here: http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040sh/ar01.html Form W-2 and Form W-3 If you file one or more Forms W-2, you must also file Form W-3. You must report both cash and noncash wages in box 1, as well as tips and other compensation. The completed Forms W-2 and W-3 in the example (in these instructions) show how the entries are made.

If you paid all of your employee's share of social security and Medicare taxes, without deducting the amounts from the employee's pay, the employee's wages are increased by the amount of that tax for income tax withholding purposes. Follow steps 1 through 3 below. (See the example in these instructions.) Enter the amounts you paid on your employee's behalf in boxes 4 and 6 (do not include your share of these taxes).

And so is Quaoar, and so is Sedna, and so is Eris, and on and on.

You will receive Forms 1099-MISC from the various entities with whom you are doing business as a contractor detailing how much money they paid you. A copy will go to the IRS also. You file a Schedule C with your Form 1040 in which you detail how much you received on the 1099-MISC forms as well as any other income that your contracting business received (e.g. amounts less than $600 for which a 1099-MISc does not need to be issued, or tips, say, if you are a taxi-driver running your own cab), and you can deduct various expenses that you incurred in generating this income, including tools, books, (or gasoline!) etc that you bought for doing the job. You will need to file a Schedule SE that will compute how much you owe in Social Security and Medicare taxes on the net income on Schedule C. You will pay at twice the rate that employees pay because you get to pay not only the employee's share but also the employer's share. At least, you will not have to pay income tax on the employer's share. Your net income on Schedule C will transfer onto Form 1040 where you will compute how much income tax you owe, and then add on the Social Security tax etc to compute a final amount of tax to be paid. You will have to pay a penalty for not making tax payments every quarter during 2013, plus  interest on the tax paid late.  Send the IRS a check for the total. If you talk to an accountant right away, he/she will likely be able to come up with a rough estimate of what you might owe, and sending in that amount by January 15 will save some money. The accountant can also help you set up for the 2014 tax year during which you could make quarterly payments of estimated tax for 2014 and avoid the penalties and interest referred to above.\"} vector={'attention': SparseVector(indices=[999, 1002, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1037, 1039, 1041, 1043, 1045, 1055, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2036, 2039, 2054, 2059, 2060, 2064, 2065, 2069, 2070, 2071, 2073, 2076, 2084, 2092, 2095, 2097, 2115, 2129, 2131, 2138, 2139, 2151, 2157, 2164, 2172, 2175, 2185, 2191, 2219, 2254, 2272, 2275, 2278, 2286, 2296, 2297, 2321, 2342, 2345, 2360, 2363, 2393, 2397, 2433, 2437, 2449, 2453, 2515, 2536, 2560, 2561, 2583, 2591, 2625, 2682, 2683, 2692, 2725, 2769, 2770, 2808, 2831, 3031, 3036, 3037, 3105, 3183, 3318, 3446, 3477, 3497, 3596, 3615, 3745, 3807, 3815, 3825, 3828, 3843, 4062, 4149, 4171, 4284, 4358, 4374, 4385, 4468, 4604, 4606, 4638, 4651, 5126, 5174, 5371, 5587, 5658, 5906, 5931, 6016, 6100, 6118, 6134, 6531, 6593, 6987, 7367, 7773, 7904, 7909, 8310, 8566, 9298, 9645, 10095, 10197, 10247, 10504, 11194, 11422, 11518, 11717, 11727, 12174, 12408, 12533, 13666, 13753, 16755, 17555, 17907, 21012, 22667, 24134, 25760, 27615, 28616], values=[0.021365827, 0.018762942, 0.008689124, 0.007421325, 0.016142134, 0.0048832237, 0.0090568075, 0.0002687166, 0.011789123, 0.0037320582, 0.2122023, 0.01729188, 0.024703318, 0.0085994, 0.0098903235, 0.002374448, 0.002726343, 0.007449136, 0.002549403, 0.0020930837, 0.014001217, 0.010209768, 0.0056788614, 0.0077068117, 0.005786076, 0.006123972, 0.016494375, 0.008162275, 0.007860885, 0.021763721, 0.012806523, 0.012606477, 0.00768168, 0.0040591196, 0.006401389, 0.0039559263, 0.012647308, 0.0070632296, 0.019275323, 0.007000057, 0.0063678757, 0.019230057, 0.0102261435, 0.009853112, 0.0102623515, 0.009379148, 0.007808963, 0.0048594936, 0.010297335, 0.014198605, 0.01799453, 0.01696855, 0.032238185, 0.009259017, 0.014005139, 0.022122255, 0.015966916, 0.008883118, 0.012330486, 0.008022147, 0.016141316, 0.030461028, 0.010431681, 0.014949455, 0.021328194, 0.023122484, 0.018882537, 0.01983478, 0.011790191, 0.01861515, 0.15343301, 0.016672088, 0.028861925, 0.06472621, 0.12645046, 0.021662764, 0.261597, 0.07909311, 0.011117439, 0.03958592, 0.014824717, 0.051976696, 0.025683, 0.060309105, 0.037991583, 0.024201153, 0.051149596, 0.016808424, 0.01652284, 0.024259984, 0.040458966, 0.028688269, 0.015031195, 0.078642, 0.019005287, 0.06705953, 0.06724779, 0.033960015, 0.019176107, 0.016060023, 0.027608417, 0.08668082, 0.026523927, 0.03473344, 0.06116302, 0.28085524, 0.04233314, 0.03260143, 0.050050214, 0.06589376, 0.06971151, 0.016461488, 0.054244556, 0.10784613, 0.33987892, 0.14148463, 0.02569131, 0.020597467, 0.044024486, 0.034922358, 0.055627227, 0.057343356, 0.1301134, 0.66189295, 0.24874268, 0.029496398, 0.040523093, 0.06607814, 0.024500905, 0.026473159, 0.017605161, 0.031540703, 0.06895726, 0.075707205, 0.033919193, 0.023922589, 0.13239697, 0.20164916, 0.03582404, 0.17347296, 0.33776104, 0.030148996, 0.70879483, 0.08771206, 0.020396609, 0.05548952, 0.05944236, 0.038700204, 0.092647634, 0.04163863, 0.039785486, 0.061427444, 0.36779988, 0.14772715, 0.18893565, 0.04729203, 0.118841246, 0.081571825, 0.69437385, 0.057447504, 1.4945651, 0.09306563, 0.05073433, 1.1828241, 0.36517963, 0.13836204, 0.5395643, 0.22594069, 0.024727095, 0.060414948, 0.23949578, 0.47099972, 0.03905759, 0.08435649, 1.5292747, 0.44025442, 0.37831673])} shard_key=None\n",

Claims for more exemptions than you are entitled to can be problematic, and the IRS might come looking if you suddenly \"\"discover\"\" several extra children for whom you are entitled to claim exemptions.\"'} vector={'attention': SparseVector(indices=[1000, 1002, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1018, 1029, 1037, 1055, 1059, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, 2031, 2035, 2041, 2042, 2043, 2047, 2054, 2059, 2061, 2062, 2064, 2065, 2067, 2071, 2084, 2085, 2089, 2108, 2115, 2126, 2147, 2149, 2157, 2193, 2195, 2272, 2279, 2306, 2320, 2336, 2420, 2433, 2453, 2525, 2529, 2558, 2559, 2560, 2566, 2591, 2595, 2625, 2696, 2741, 2758, 2946, 2976, 3036, 3183, 3198, 3263, 3318, 3402, 3477, 3533, 3713, 3745, 4171, 4219, 4366, 4447, 4469, 4502, 4606, 4709, 4851, 4852, 5278, 5356, 5371, 5834, 6176, 6932, 7523, 7773, 9837, 10532, 11194, 11612, 12640, 14140, 14905, 15242, 18636, 19621, 23410, 24850, 24964, 25760, 26854, 27615, 28393], values=[0.09594793, 0.043350417, 0.0047566225, 0.011495873, 0.012249554, 0.0059395246, 0.018016748, 0.0002466274, 0.016307203, 0.22426887, 0.017800506, 0.0026571702, 0.008437474, 0.5855252, 0.0034791776, 0.005303044, 0.0028138089, 0.003377648, 0.0031805013, 0.0033893462, 0.014028201, 0.0064959903, 0.0072990363, 0.019032147, 0.012583038, 0.010897787, 0.011095549, 0.015882654, 0.02030545, 0.020251183, 0.008566496, 0.008290522, 0.006722957, 0.009055073, 0.00831893, 0.013794162, 0.008820156, 0.011913235, 0.04743619, 0.025954155, 0.01471384, 0.028700372, 0.010934056, 0.014367343, 0.014216123, 0.013915292, 0.00802291, 0.006017513, 0.017895937, 0.02149068, 0.012995884, 0.015554401, 0.036667544, 0.019430345, 0.017502805, 0.018247267, 0.05023761, 0.096626684, 0.019085707, 0.026353562, 0.049053214, 0.023340981, 0.03871101, 0.036726486, 0.02468844, 0.4862853, 0.056867786, 0.058774136, 0.03211026, 0.04403677, 0.1428598, 0.09700976, 0.02511576, 0.036851056, 0.026827471, 0.08571152, 0.05357595, 0.06748689, 0.11593766, 0.08521559, 0.04199734, 0.035440557, 0.102651946, 0.06677461, 0.046313763, 0.048832595, 1.1980728, 0.07630996, 0.04093327, 0.15611552, 0.31345758, 0.096541695, 0.031472113, 0.15905154, 0.085741036, 0.048719242, 0.11830968, 0.12318537, 0.046177063, 0.03869172, 0.08085236, 0.06271047, 0.03881864, 0.038078588, 0.21530959, 0.07364594, 0.029374516, 0.04912362, 0.1195037, 0.21761918, 0.05625599, 1.0891365, 0.119119205, 0.5085559, 1.3943532, 0.16855845, 0.16626537, 0.22457328, 0.045507297, 0.05445736, 0.63731635, 0.21350853, 0.32473364, 0.08722352, 1.5292747, 0.20803514, 0.3549776, 0.27501836])} shard_key=None\n",
